# When comparing multithreading, multiprocessing, and asynchronous programming in Python, 
# it’s essential to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and use cases, especially in the context of Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). 
# Each of these concurrency models solves different types of performance bottlenecks:

# 1. Multithreading
# Concept: Multithreading refers to the execution of multiple threads (smaller units of a process) within the same process. 
# In Python, threads share the same memory space, allowing them to communicate more easily. 
# This is useful for I/O-bound tasks like reading/writing to a file, handling network connections, etc.

# Key Points:
# Concurrency: Achieved via threads running concurrently (interswitching rapidly) on a single CPU core or across multiple cores.
# I/O-Bound Tasks: Great for tasks that spend time waiting for external operations (file I/O, network requests).
# GIL Limitations: Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) prevents true parallel execution of threads in CPU-bound tasks. 
# The GIL ensures that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time.
# Example Use Case: Web servers like Flask/Django using threading for handling multiple requests concurrently but not in parallel.
# Pros:

# Shared memory space between threads, which makes communication and data sharing easy.
# Suitable for I/O-bound tasks.
# Cons:

# Not suitable for CPU-bound tasks due to the GIL, which limits parallelism.
# Complex debugging due to shared state (race conditions, deadlocks).
# Code Example:
import threading
def task():
    print("Task is running")  
thread = threading.Thread(target=task)
thread.start()
thread.join()  # Wait for the thread to complete

# 2. Multiprocessing
# Concept: Unlike multithreading, multiprocessing involves running multiple processes, each with its own memory space. 
# Python's multiprocessing module spawns separate processes that bypass the GIL, enabling true parallelism, especially useful for CPU-bound tasks.

# Key Points:
# Parallelism: Each process runs independently on a different CPU core, making it suitable for CPU-intensive tasks (e.g., mathematical computations, image processing).
# CPU-Bound Tasks: Best for tasks that need parallel execution across multiple cores, like data processing or computation-heavy operations.
# Memory: Each process has its own memory space, so data sharing between processes requires inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms like pipes, queues, or shared memory.
# Example Use Case: Running heavy computations like image manipulation, matrix operations in machine learning using multiprocessing.
# Pros:

# Achieves true parallelism.
# Ideal for CPU-bound tasks.
# No GIL limitation, as each process has its own interpreter and memory space.
# Cons:

# Higher memory usage since each process has its own memory space.
# Data sharing between processes is more complicated compared to threads.
# Processes have higher overhead in creation and communication compared to threads.
# Code Example:
import multiprocessing
def task():
    print("Task is running")
process = multiprocessing.Process(target=task)
process.start()
process.join()  # Wait for the process to complete

# 3. Asynchronous Programming
# Concept: Asynchronous programming involves writing code that can pause and wait for certain operations (usually I/O-bound) to complete without blocking the main thread. 
# Python provides this using asyncio, which allows for non-blocking execution and cooperative multitasking. It uses an event loop to schedule tasks.

# Key Points:
# Concurrency: Achieved through non-blocking I/O, which allows the program to handle multiple tasks at once by switching between them when one task is waiting (e.g., waiting for I/O to complete).
# I/O-Bound Tasks: Highly effective for handling many I/O operations concurrently (e.g., downloading files, web scraping, handling thousands of network requests).
# Single-Threaded: Typically runs on a single thread, though asyncio can be paired with threading or multiprocessing to achieve hybrid models.
# Example Use Case: Network applications (e.g., web servers, database clients) handling many connections concurrently using asyncio.
# Pros:

# Low memory usage compared to multithreading/multiprocessing.
# Best suited for I/O-bound tasks.
# Easier to write and understand once familiar with async/await syntax.
# Cons:

# Not suitable for CPU-bound tasks.
# Requires a shift in thinking about how tasks execute (non-blocking execution can be harder to grasp initially).
# Not truly parallel (all tasks are run on a single thread, unless combined with threading or multiprocessing).
# Code Example:
import asyncio

async def task():
    print("Task is running")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    
asyncio.run(task())  # Run the async function

# When to Use Which:
# Multithreading: Ideal for I/O-bound tasks where waiting is involved, like reading/writing files, web scraping, or network I/O. It’s simpler when threads need to share memory.

# Multiprocessing: Best for CPU-bound tasks, such as number crunching, machine learning model training, or image processing, where you want to utilize multiple CPU cores. Since each process has its own memory, you avoid the GIL limitation.

# Asynchronous Programming: The go-to choice for handling many I/O-bound tasks, especially where the program spends a lot of time waiting for external operations (e.g., network requests). It scales well for handling thousands of connections (e.g., web servers, I/O-heavy applications) with lower memory usage compared to threading or multiprocessing.

# Each approach fits a specific set of problems, and understanding the nature of your task—whether it is I/O-bound or CPU-bound—helps in selecting the right concurrency model.
